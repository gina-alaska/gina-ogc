# gina-ogc
The public repo for documentation, tools and issue tracking of GINA's WMS, WFS, and WCS servers.

The [Geographic Information Network of Alaska](http://gina.alaska.edu) uses many of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) services to distribute geospatial data.  This is the public repository to help track issues related to those services.

A few of the ore prominent OGC service end points provided by GINA:
 * wms.alaskamapped.org/bdl - GINA's Best Available Data Layer for Alaskan Imagery
 * wms.alaskamapped.org/ortho - the Alaska Statewide Orthomosaic Map - a 2010-2015 satellite derived basemap for Alaska
 * wms.alaskamapped.org/extras - A collection of other interesting and handy imagery baselayers for Alaska
 * ogc.gina.alaska.edu/espcor

 The system configuration for this is handled through GINA's Chef configuration management cookbook [gina-ogc-cookbook](https://github.com/gina-alaska/gina-ogc-cookbook) *note: that repo is private for GINA system admins to manage the backend systems*.
